# comview

The finest diff viewer ever compressed into a small terminal program. It reads a unified diff from stdin, renders it beautifully, and lets you review code without becoming a web browser.

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rockorager/comview.git
cd comview
mise run install
```

To install somewhere else:

```sh
PREFIX=$HOME/.local mise run install
```

To use comview as the default pager for `git diff` and `git show`:

```sh
git config --global pager.diff comview
git config --global pager.show comview
```

## Usage

```sh
git diff | comview
git show | comview
gh pr diff 123 | comview
comview watch
comview watch --staged
comview watch -- git show HEAD
```

`comview watch` reruns `git diff` and refreshes the view whenever the diff
output changes. Arguments after `watch` are passed to `git diff`; use `--` to
watch another diff-producing command.

Comments are saved to `.comview/comments.json`.
